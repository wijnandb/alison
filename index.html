							<h3 class="iconbox-title">Hatha yoga</h3>
							<div class="iconbox-desc">
								Hatha yoga is the common name given to all styles of physical yoga. The exercises are known as asanas or postures and are designed to stretch, stimulate and stress different parts of the body - muscles, joints and connective tissue. The postures are also designed to open the many channels of the body, especially the main channel, the spine, so that energy can flow freely. Hatha yoga is different from other types of exercise in that the primary focus is on the breath and cultivating awareness.

							<h3 class="iconbox-title">Yin yoga</h3>
							<div class="iconbox-desc">
								In Yin yoga we hold a posture for 3-5 minutes to stimulate and therapeutically stretch the connective tissues that wrap around our muscles and joints. We learn to listen to our bodies and come into the suggested shape finding our appropriate edge where we feel the stretch. The simple practice of becoming still and quiet for several minutes is in itself very challenging and can be combined with mindfulness meditation. This practice is highly beneficial for your nervous system, organs, muscles and joints.

							<h3 class="iconbox-title">Restorative yoga</h3>
							<div class="iconbox-desc">
								Restorative yoga is not about stretching or strengthening but about total relaxation. Yoga props such as bolsters, blankets and blocks are used to support the body in a position of complete ease and comfort to allow you to completely relax. Restorative yoga means non-doing, non-busyness and simply being and is the perfect yoga practice for anyone suffering from stress, burn-out or overwork. Learning practical ways to consciously relax and unwind is calming for your nervous system. No matter how busy you are sometimes you need to take time to do nothing!

							<h3 class="iconbox-title">Mindfulness meditation</h3>
							<div class="iconbox-desc">
								Mindfulness means paying attention in a particular way to notice our moment to moment experience in a non-judgmental and open-hearted way. Mindfulness meditation is derived from the Buddhist practice of Vipassana or Insight meditation which has been practised for more than 2,500 years. The effectiveness of mindfulness as a way of treating stress-related conditions as well as anxiety, depression and chronic pain have been proven by numerous scientific studies.

						<div class="pfblock-line"></div>
						<div class="pfblock-subtitle">
							I am an experienced and well-qualified Hatha yoga instructor since 2009 (Yoga Alliance ERYT 500 hours) and I teach group classes, private sessions, workshops and teacher trainings.<br>I specialize in teaching a gentle style of yoga in particular Yin and Restorative yoga especially aimed at people looking to de-stress and learn active relaxation exercises. As well as being an experienced yoga teacher for many years, I am a mindfulness trainer and combine mindfulness and yoga to train the mind and heart as well as the body. The practice of yoga was traditionally taught on an individual basis so that the hundreds of different postures could be adapted to the unique needs of an individual student. Modern day yoga has moved away from this yogic tradition and increasingly focuses on yoga as a form of physical exercise done in large groups with very little possibility for individual attention.<br><br>
                            
I am offering personalized yoga instruction to create a yoga and meditation practice to meet your own personal needs. After an intake session we will work together to create a yoga and mindfulness practice that addresses any underlying health issues as well as giving you some yoga homework so that you can practice at home between sessions.
